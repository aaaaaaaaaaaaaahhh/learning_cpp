## arrays
1. `int my_array[ <size> ];`
   1. a bit different than java
   2. the spaces in the brackets are the same when getting an element
2. multi dimensional array is the same as java just with this syntax
   1. only exception is that regular 2d arrays in c++ have to be rectangular, they cannot be jagged
3. passing arrays through functions is the same as java
